Codecademy project focusing on responsive design using CSS and HTML only

This project was completed through the Front Freelance Website Development course.

Overal goal:
The goal of this project was to apply the responsive design techniques learned throughout this weeks lesson material.
The HTML and CSS was coded from scratch. Pictures were supplied along with a finished page design with demetions necessary to implement respnosive design.

We started with the shell of HTML and CSS for basic desktop features.

Difficulties:
  1. Still getting used to all the ins and outs of CSS layout, flex-box aspects, and combining my knowledge thus far for a responsive site. As of 7/4/17, CSS and HTML have only been learned through Codecademy. After this week at DigitalCrafts, I'm hoping to come back to this project and have much more knowledge of the two languages and how best to structure each code.
 Â 2. To piggy back on #1, responsive design with different media screen sizes is not going as planned as I can see there are still issues with my CSS code. The responsive design is not altering the site like I would like.
