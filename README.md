Codecademy project focusing on responsive design

This project was completed through the Front Freelance Website Development course.

Overal goal:
The goal of this project was to apply the responsive design techniques learned throughout this weeks lesson material.
The HTML and CSS was coded from scratch. Pictures were supplied along with a finished page design with demetions necessary to implement respnosive design.

We started with the shell of HTML and CSS. From there, we started adding @media only screen specific to the max-width to create a more user friendly design.
